Often it is desirable to get the current list of members. As we have a CRM and that CRM can be used to pull a member list, this then represents the gross steps required to get a full list.

#### Get a List of Non-Lifetime Members

1. Log into [Copper](https://copper.com/).
2. On the left hand side, click People.
3. Click the Filters drop-down (looks like an upside down pyramid).
4. Make sure you Clear All to clear all current filters.
5. Go down to Membership End and click it. It should produce a pop-up with dates in it.
6. Make sure Fixed Dates is selected.
7. In the From: side of things choose today's date.
8. Leave the To: side of things blank. It will have a date in it that LOOKS like today's date but it is grayed out meaning that it is technically empty.
9. Click Apply.
10. Select All (checkbox at the top left).
11. Click the three dots next to the pencil.
12. Click Export List. This will produce an Excel document.

#### Get a List of Lifetime Members

2. On the left hand side, click People.

#### Combine the Lists

Use whatever program you like (Google Sheets, Excel, etc) to combine the two lists you just generated.

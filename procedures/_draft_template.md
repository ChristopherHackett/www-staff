## *Replace with a title that describes what this is about, such as Chapter Procedures"

Think about the policy in terms of creating, updating or maintaining, or decommissioning or deleting something under the policy, for example, think abou the lifecycle of events, chapters, members, etc, and document each procedure. 

## Relevant Policies

* [Policy 1]() - the primary governing policies
* [Policy 2]() - supplemental policies
* [Policy 3]() - supplemental policies
* [Bylaw section]() - membership and director eligibility is documented in bylaws

## How to *do a thing*

*Describe the request relevant to the policy, for example, creating a new member, adding a chapter*

### SLA

This procedure have an SLA of x hours, and should be performed *(every time someone submits a request)(every week)(once a month)(once a quarter)(once a year)*.

### *Process*

*Describe the steps required to do the process as outlined in policy. Make it unambiguous and consistent, so that if someone else or automation does it, they do it right the first time, quickly and within SLA, and consistently. If there is a judgement call to make, please document the rubric for that judgement call, such as "an event must be profitable to be approved, or a chapter must not be within 80 km or less than 1 hour away"*

1. *Replace me with Step 1*
2. *Replace me with Step 2*
3. *Replace me with Step 3*
4. *Replace me with a quality assurance step to make sure it's done completely and right*

### QA / Consistency / Reconcilliation Check

*Describe the steps you'd take to make sure that we've complied with policy, particularly if the steps are manual, or the automation is incapable of doing a documented policy step, or we have to trust the automation and provide an oversight report to the Board. For example, every month, an audit of complementary members should be undertaken to ensure that these are truly active leaders, or every month, an audit of discount codes used by members are not being abused, or every time, a check to ensure that a chapter is not too close to another chapter.*

## Exception Process

*If your policy allows for exceptions or exemptions to be approved, document under what rubric or circumstances will you approve and process such exceptions / exemptions? Generally exceptions should be recorded and reviewed at least every six months to a year, to prevent evergreen exceptions to the policy, which essentially bypasses policy and will lead to folks asking for exceptions continuously. Where do you document these exceptions, and who is involved in the review? Exceptions shouldn't be granted all that often, and should have a truly compelling mission outcome, such as a huge restricted donation or the ability for a flagship project or global event to occur that wouldn't otherwise be approved. Generally, exceptions should require ED or for amounts outside ED approval, Board co-approval.*

Issues with current policies that are blockers, risks, or issues:

* Blockers - the policy says something that we really can't do, such as keeping PII on minors, etc. 
* Risks - e.g. if too many people take advantage of this process, we'll go broke, damage our reputation risk, legal liability, etc
* Issues - the policy describes something that we shouldn't do, or there's conflicting statements on two different policies, and we want to stop folks from choosing their own policy, or forcing us to reverse our decision, or we can't manage to policy.

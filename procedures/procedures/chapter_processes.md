## Add/Change Chapter Leadership Process - same ticket as New Chapter Request
 Relevant Policy: [Chapter Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters) and [Leaders Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/leader)
    **Remove leader**
    * The Leader(s) stepping down sends an email to the Foundation.  
    * Complimentary membership and owasp.org email address will be suspended when the email is received.
 **Add New leader(s)**
    * Submit [Start New chapter/new leader request ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/73)

    * Create owasp.org email address for the leader(s)

    * Leader to update leader.md file in the chapter repository - leader name and leader owarp.org email address
**SLA for first response is 72 hours and 144 working hours to complete; pauses when ticket is set to "Waiting for Customer Response"**
**Issue:** Membership policy does not address what happens to a complimentary membership if a leader steps down or the chapter is deemed inactive. 
OWASP.org email addresses deactivation did not follow a consistant policy when membership or leadership ended. This was and still is manual process.

Response to the Requestor: Send Leader(s) New Meetup templated email in CRM with URL. 
   
**SLA for first response is 72 working hours; pauses when ticket is set to "Waiting for Customer Response"**
**Issue:** 
1. Meetup Groups are set up by city location, not region or country. 
2. Some Leaders do not join or use Meetup. 
3. Allowed to use other social media do not post activity on chapter page.
5. Automation not available to truly identify 3 meeting activity but just identifies activity as simply as opening and closing a file in the chapter repository.

* Notice pops back when completed.
* Templated response in Copper to sent leader.
* ID and password automatically sent to the leaders listed in chapter repository leader md file.
* To resend need to go to domain look in all the zoom leader groups one thru ? to find the chapter name. (This is the zoom ID)
* Look up in admin.google.com which leaders-zoom- account the chapter is in.
* Go to LastPass and copy the password for that account.
* Go to onetimesecret.com and paste the password into the text field, do NOT select add a passcode (or whatever they call it) and then create link. Send that link to one leader (You will have to do this process for each leader if you are sending to more than one because the link 'disappears' once one leader accesses it).

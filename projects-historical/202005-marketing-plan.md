## Abstract

Given our updated budget for 2020, generally the marketing plan primarily focuses on driving attendance for our virtual events, promoting our projects, maintaining an online, and various clean-up activities that prepare the Foundation for the recovery.

Promotion of our virtual and Global events will include email marketing and social tactics. These campaigns will start no later than three weeks prior to the event, and sooner where possible. Social content will promote the content and speakers/trainers using hashtags and mentions where appropriate. In the final weeks leading up to events, social postings frequency will increase to several a day.

By law in the EU, the OWASP Foundation must comply with GDPR rules, and in particular assuring that email marketing lists are exclusively opt-in subscriptions. It is unknown if the OWASP Foundation mailing list is GDPR compliant. The Foundation shall take the most conservative approach to this effort and will require all email lists to be opt-in regardless of subscriber geography.

The OWASP website has many options to feature the work of the Foundation. Two featured locations on the home page are for a project and a chapter. Additionally the site has a blog/news section. Monthly the Foundation will feature a different project and chapter on the homepage. Additionally, the Foundation will strive to have a new blog/news story weekly.

Just over 20% of the revenue in the updated 2020 budget, is from Corporate Membership. Marketing will work with Development to source and close memberships. The Foundation will explore new ways to source leads for this activity and ensure the team has the tools needed to close and nurture new corporate members, while retaining existing members of the Foundation.

Research and proactively seek out global partnerships that have the potential to feature/promote OWASP projects to the builder/defender/breaker communities. Historically the Foundation engaged BlackHat and DEFCON in an off-line manner for these efforts. This strategy needs to be expanded to more partners and include online efforts.

Currently our social media channels are passively managed. Following an audit and the onboarding on a community manager, the Foundation will develop an aggressive content calendar with storylines, features, and paid/earned promotion.

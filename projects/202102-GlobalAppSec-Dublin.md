### Venue

Convention Center Dublin:
Spencer Dock
North Wall Quay
Dublin 1
D01 T1W6
Ireland

Situated at the heart of Dublin’s transport hub with excellent air, road, rail and sea connections, The Convention Centre Dublin is easily accessible for all!

By Air
Dublin is highly accessible for delegates travelling from the UK, Europe, the US, and beyond. Dublin Airport is just 15 minutes from The Convention Centre Dublin via the Port Tunnel and serves over 180 routes – including direct flights to all major UK and European cities and daily flights to the Emirates and several North American cities.

For your journey to The CCD, the Airlink airport shuttle bus stops directly outside the building, while taxi and car hire services are also easily available.

By Car or Taxi
The Convention Centre Dublin is just minutes away from Ireland’s M50 motorway network and Dublin’s Port Tunnel, making it easy to bring in supplies and equipment for your event. It is also next to the Samuel Beckett Bridge which spans the River Liffey, aiding access between the North and South of the city.

The CCD has its own underground car park, with over 2,000 spaces located in car parks nearby, as well as considerable on street ‘pay and display’ parking on North Wall Quay and adjoining roads.

Find out more about parking near The CCD and access for deliveries.

By Rail, Tram or Bus
Conveniently located in Dublin’s Docklands, the business hub of the city, The Convention Centre Dublin can be accessed via a growing network of public transport options.

Rail and DART
The CCD is less than 10 minutes on the Luas Red Line from Dublin’s two main railway stations, Connolly and Heuston. Operated by Irish Rail, these stations serve all the major towns and cities in Ireland.

The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) rail network runs along the coast of Dublin, from Malahide and Howth, to Bray and Graystones, providing transport from the city centre to suburban areas. Connolly, Pearse Street and Tara Street DART stations are all located about 10 minutes’ walk from The CCD.

Tram (Luas)
Luas is Dublin’s light rail transit system. There are two lines, the Green Line and the Red Line. The CCD is on the Red Line, conveniently linking to downtown Dublin and Connolly and Heuston rail stations. Major Square and Spencer Dock are the closest stops. Switch between the Red and Green lines at Abbey Street / O’Connell – GPO / Marlborough stops.

# Projects Summit - Summer

## Overview

Each project will have a 2-3 paragraph overview narrative. Keep to the key top points about the project. Visitors should be able to read this short narrative and have a good understanding of the project without having to scroll the entire document.

## Project Links

Use this section for important links for projects/events that visitors will need. For instance, if this is an event, links to CFT, CPT and registration is handy If there is a microsite, that would be good to link to as well

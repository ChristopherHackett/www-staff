Spectators are not welcomed and attendance is limited to OWASP Members. Limited travel assistance will be provided for up to five key project leaders/contributors per project selected.

Leaders of projects selected are required to attend or that project will not be selected. If a project fails to secure five attendees, their project's invitation will be rescinded.

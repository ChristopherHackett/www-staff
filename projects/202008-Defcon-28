# DEFCON 28

## Overview

Each project will have a 2-3 paragraph overview narrative. Keep to the key top points about the project. Visitors should be able to read this short narrative and have a good understanding of the project without having to scroll the entire document.

## Project Links

Use this section for important links for projects/events that visitors will need. For instance, if this is an event, links to CFT, CPT and registration is handy If there is a microsite, that would be good to link to as well

## Goals

1. Include top-level goals of the project in an ordered list
2. Give thought to the ordering of goals. Revenue, attendance, launch date
3. Make sure goals are measurable from undisputed source

## Milestones

* In an unordered list (billeted) list major milestones in chronological order
* Use the syntax of 2019-01-19, Milestone name, [Name of Owner]
* When milestones are completed, mark them as such with ??
* A milestone isn't everyone’s to-do list, it is the high level tasks of the project
* If you have more than 20 milestones, you’re being too granular

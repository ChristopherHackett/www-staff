# OWASP Virtual Training Day
  
```
April 28-29, 2020

OWASP Virtual Training Day will take place for 4 hours on both April 28th and 29th. Up to 10 separate trainings will be offered across both Europe and North America. Sponsorships will also be offered as well as an ancillary CTF event.

## Goals

1. Bring alternative training to no less than 145 ppl in our community

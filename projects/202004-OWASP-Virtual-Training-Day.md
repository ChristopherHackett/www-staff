# OWASP Virtual Training Day
  
```
April 28-29, 2020

```

OWASP Virtual Training Day will take place for 4 hours on both April 28th and 29th. Up to 10 separate trainings will be offered across both Europe and North America. Sponsorships will also be offered as well as an ancillary CTF event.

## Goals

1. Bring alternative training to no less than 145 ppl in our community
2. Interact with the community in a different way since face-to-face is not an option 
3. Generate revenue that was lost due to the postponement of the Global AppSec Dublin

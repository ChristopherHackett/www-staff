# RegOnline Closure

## Overview

RegOnline has been discontinued by the vender and the EOL is end of December 2019. OWASP has used RegOnline for Global and various events for the past several years. There is event metric and attendee information in the platform that we would want to archive prior to the system going offline. Additionally we should ensure our credit balances have been completely moved to our bank accounts prior to December 31, 2019.

## Charity Spending Guidelines

Generally, it is best practice for non-profits to spend at least 80% of their funding on "Programs" - with the goal of getting to 85% or better. The FY22 budget forecasts the OWASP Foundation will spend 68.1% of its funds on Programming. A major goal is to get this to 80% by increasing revenue and maintaining low expenses through out the year.

FY22 apportions program management and staff costs to program delivery, which is aligned with common non-profit accounting practices, and also ensures that each program delivery area has an opportunity to earn income, fundraising and sponsorships, rather than solely rely upon Foundation income from global events and event sponsorship.

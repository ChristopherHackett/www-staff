## OWASP 2022 Budget

APPROVED by Board of Directors at the [January 2022 Board Meeting](https://owasp.org/www-board/meetings-historical/202201#motion-to-approve-the-2022-budget)


### 2021 Financial Performance

With the assistance of OWASP's 20th Anniversary, 2021 turned out to be a far better year than expected. The approved 2021 budget was exceeded in nearly all respects.

| Description | Budgeted | Actual | Percent |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Income | $1,000,000 | $1,000,000 | 100% |
| Expenses | $1,000,000 | $1,000,000 | 100% |


### 2022 Income Forecast

Income in 2022 is projected to be $2.2 million, which is $1.1 million more than the 2021 actual.

### 2022 Expenses Forecast

Expenses in 2022 are up by x% since 2021. This is a good time to invest as we start to come out of the COVID era.

### Future outlook

As we emerge from COVID, resuming in person events raises costs, but also raises income, which should only improve OWASP's financial performance. We continue to look for ways to reduce expenses, such as eliminating make work and consolidation of platforms, and invest in ways to reduce costs, such as the new Association Management Platform.

## Charity Spending Guidelines

Generally, it is best practice for non-profits to spend at least 80% of their funding on "Programs" - with the goal of getting to 85% or better. The FY22 budget forecasts the OWASP Foundation will spend 68.1% of its funds on Programming. A major goal is to get this to 80% by increasing revenue and maintaining low expenses through out the year.

FY22 apportions program management and staff costs to program delivery, which is aligned with common non-profit accounting practices, and also ensures that each program delivery area has an opportunity to earn income, fundraising and sponsorships, rather than solely rely upon Foundation income from global events and event sponsorship.

## OWASP 2021 Budget

In 2021, we are forecasting a small net loss of \$94k, with a budgeted income of \$1,408,433 (down 36.5% from \$2,218,745 in 2020), and expenses of \$1,502,878 (down 31.8% from \$2,202,512 in 2020). COVID has been an especially challenging time for the OWASP Foundation, which prides itself on spending on mission per non-profit best practices. Our goal is to keep expenses and overheads as low as we can, enhance delivery of our mission through fundamental finance and policy reform, and diversify our income sources dramatically, whilst adding many new sources of income.

### 2020 Financial Performance

OWASP exceeded the revised COVID era Budget Model Z targets by over \$316,000, and we made a small profit for the year. Despite this, in 2020, OWASP has had a income reduction of 37.5% year on year over 2019. As a result, we had to take drastic action to reduce our costs to the bare minimum. We had to defer the two scheduled Global AppSecs, which in a normal year, pays for nearly all of OWASP's expenses and allows us to save for the future.

### 2021 Income Forecast

In 2021, we forecast a very conservative income stream based around the activity and earnings of the latter part of 2020. As this is a conservative forecast, we need to add new lines of business, merchandise, fundraising, grant seeking, donations, increase corporate and individual memberships, and to run sufficient numbers of virtual events to try to plug the gap in our income created by not running any in person events in 2020 and 2021. We will be leaving no stone unturned as we look to new revenue sources and government relief throughout the year.

### 2021 Expenses Forecast

Shedding \$700k in expenses in a single year is testament to the hard work and belt tightening by our staff and community since 2019. We will continue to keep a very close eye on expenses, and with finance reform, we are expecting lower administrative overheads and costs, which is required as the community returns to in person events and activities and starts spending to similar levels as 2019.

### Future outlook

We plan on returning to two Global AppSec events in Dublin in June and San Francisco in October 2022, which will create pressure on the Foundation to pay some large deposits early in 2022, in return for hopefully a healthy profit and then financial recovery in 2023.

## Charity Spending Guidelines

Generally, it is best practice for non-profits to spend at least 80% of their funding on "Programs" - with the goal of getting to 85% or better. The FY21 budget forecasts the OWASP Foundation will spend 68.1% of its funds on Programming. A major goal is to get this to 80% by increasing revenue and maintaining low expenses through out the year.

Please note, compared to prior years, FY21 now apportions program management and staff costs to program delivery, which is aligned with common non-profit accounting practices, and also ensures that each program delivery area has an opporutnity to earn income, fundraising and sponsorships, rather than solely rely upon Foundation income from global events and event sponsorship.

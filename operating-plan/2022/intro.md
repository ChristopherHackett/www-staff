## Introduction

The OWASP Foundation has navigated 2021 with some difficulty, but we have met or exceeded our budget and delivered more reform than in any time of our history. We have recovered much of the lost trust from the community by deeply involving them in our organization and the outcomes. Everyone should be proud of the work they have done in 2021. 

After the successful reform of so many of OWASP's policies to return our focus to our community, it's time to eliminate the burrs and friction of doing business with the Foundation. We will be undertaking a top to bottom customer experience review, with a focus on eliminating all unnecessary procedures, policies, and optimizing what remains with a strong focus on building our community at scale. This means any procedure or policy that has a large impact on staff time will be investigated and automated or removed. Our staff must enable and support the community, not create unnecessary work for either the community or the Foundation itself. The cornerstone of this strategy is "one touch" and "self-service automation first".

We plan to break through 7000 financial members in 2022, and 10,000 members by 2025 at the latest, so anything we do to allow everyone to manage their own affairs will be done. To that end, we will be writing our business requirements, evaluating our current and potential future systems with a view to implementing an off the shelf association management platform and best of breed event management system. The primary focus of both changes is complete self-service and automation of our core processes, reduce the burdens on staff, and reduce costs.

## Introduction

## Goals

- Evaluate and implement Association Management Software for Chapters
- Increase number of active chapters to 75%
- Increase number of chapter meetings by 25%
- Increase RSVPs by 25%
- $125k in chapter fundraising activities in 2022, with 100% of chapter fundraising to fund chapter expenses

## Program Deliverables

### Chapter Customer Experience

Currently, it's difficult for chapter leaders and chapter members to do basic things, like maintain their chapter pages, register and attend meetings, and more. We will be conducting town halls with stakeholders (chapter committee, leaders, attendees, speakers, local chapter sponsors and supporters) to identify issues with the current customer experience, and work towards eliminating unnecessary friction, any unenforceable policies or procedures, and ensure that we deliver a consistent, highly repeatable chapter experience for all our different types of chapters.  

### New Association Management System

The current ad hoc system is extremely expensive and does not deliver the most basic chapter management functions, such as "who is a member of X chapter" or self service of leadership functions, with a resulting poor CX. We will be investigating association management platforms that integrate with our underlying accounting system to determine if we can obtain for a much lower price by retiring custom development, Meetup, Copper CRM, EventBrite, and others, whilst improving our customer experience by using an off the shelf association management platform.

- Chapter Member self-service via web and mobile app
- Leader self service via web and mobile app
- Increase engagement through evidence based metrics and analytics
- Allow chapters to do content marketing of their chapter meetings to members
- Allow chapter members to manage their CPE credits
- Chapter scheduling and RSVP for virtual, hybrid and physical chapter meetings and local events
- Chapter activity and other metrics to allow the appropriate oversight and management of chapters
- Ability to do donations and fundraise through the AMS
- Retention marketing capabilities (i.e. OWASP Rewards)
- Hopefully replace Meetup, saving $44k per year
- Possibly replace Copper CRM for member and chapter management

### Chapter Swag

As we get back into physical meetings, our previous swag measures needs to be modernized and updated. This project will allow:

- The Board to allocate a certain amount of budget to permit chapters to seed swag
- Encourage chapters to fundraise to cover the costs of their swag
- The Foundation to create a set of logos and templates for stickers and other merch designs to start the process
- The community to submit designs that are vetted for Brand usage compliance by the Foundation
- Maintain a list of low cost local suppliers all over the world so that we can reduce shipping costs and time to obtain swag

## Fundraising

Chapters are central to our mission. We will be working with the community and the Chapter committee to foster a fundraising culture. The year 1 goal of this program is to work out what is legally and logistically possible, and to raise on average $500 USD per chapter, for an overall fundraising budget of $125k to cover all chapter expenses. We would love for chapters to become self funding completely by Year 3 of the chapter fundraising program, including very large chapters.

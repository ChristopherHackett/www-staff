Rather than just re-skinning our current wiki or placing a simplified landing page in front of our site, we plan to migrate to an entirely new platform. The project must better connect with our developer audience and be valuable when visited on a variety of devices. It must be possible for elements of our site to be managed by our communities or through automation and any platform change must retain these attributes as well as ensuring continuity of analytics, permissions design, and redirect of inbound links. A proof of concept will be complete by July 1. Once the new website is launched, the wiki will be archived through 2020 for historical purposes.Upon the completion of this project, OWASP.org will be hosted in Github. The architecture will place a repository for each logical entity of the foundation in one organizational account. For instance, there would be a repo for each chapter, project, event, and several other organizational entities. This design will increase source control and allow us to connect visitors with the content that is of interest to them.",

There are a variety of reason for this change (1) ongoing data syncrhonization issues, (2) problematic SalesForce implmentation needs complete retool for continued use, (3) cost of third party softare to manage members in SalesForce is ~$10,000 per year, and (4) nearly all email to members is sent through Mailchimp. The audience on Mailchimp will be **OWASP-main** and members can be identified by the membership-end-date being after today's date.This project will consolidate the OWASP Foundation membership infomation into MailChimp. Historical member payments will be maintained as a log in Stripe and work item before eo2019 will be to import historical membership transaction data into Stripe.  The unique identifier for members will their personal email address.",
